<p>Reviewed: Mash X-Ride Trail 650
Mash_X-Ride_Trail_650_01
This could be the shortest motorcycle review in history.

With some modern bikes you could almost write a book about the various features and technical innovations, but the Mash X-Ride Trail 650 has none of that. It’s an old school iron horse with an engine based on a 35 year old Honda design and a look that owes an awful lot to Yamaha’s iconic XT500 dirt bike. That’s a good thing and, if the idea of a modern day XT500 floats your boat, read on…

Mash is a French company, developing a range of motorcycles around Chinese built motors, which in turn are based on well proven Japanese tech. The X-Ride 650 has been around for a few years now, but the 2023 line up includes this ‘Trail’ version alongside the standard model – the main difference being a different exhaust and the adoption of a 21” front and 18” rear wheel, instead of 17” front and rear on the standard machine.
